In order for mods to be used by this manager, they have to contain a 'PCUEMOD' folder containing a compatible 'mod.xml' file.

'+' means that the mod is installed and the associated mod.xml file is found.

'*' means that the mod is installed and the associated mod.xml file is missing (This isn't a problem, it just means that when you uninstall the mod, it will be removed from the modlist).

You can change the backup directory in the user.config file located at "%localappdata%\Pandemonium_Classic_-_Mod\(some shit)\1.0.0.0\user.config"

it's alright to quit the PCUEMOD installer before you click 'Finish'
